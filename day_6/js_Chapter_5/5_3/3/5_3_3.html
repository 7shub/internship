    <h3><b>Create a function truncate(str, maxlength) that checks the length of the str and, if it exceeds maxlength - replaces the end of str with the ellipsis character "…", to make its length equal to maxlength.
        <br>The result of the function should be the truncated (if needed) string.</b></h3>

        For instance:

        truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20) == "What I'd like to te…"

        truncate("Hi everyone!", 20) == "Hi everyone!"
