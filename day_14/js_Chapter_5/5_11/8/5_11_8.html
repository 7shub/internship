    <h3><b>You have an array of user objects, each one has name, surname and id.<br>
        Write the code to create another array from it, of objects with id and fullName, where fullName is generated from name and surname.
        </b></h3>
    <pre>
        For instance:

        let john = { name: "John", surname: "Smith", id: 1 };
        let pete = { name: "Pete", surname: "Hunt", id: 2 };
        let mary = { name: "Mary", surname: "Key", id: 3 };

        let users = [ john, pete, mary ];

        let usersMapped = /* ... your code ... */

        /*
        usersMapped = [
        { fullName: "John Smith", id: 1 },
        { fullName: "Pete Hunt", id: 2 },
        { fullName: "Mary Key", id: 3 }
        ]
        */

        alert( usersMapped[0].id ) // 1
        alert( usersMapped[0].fullName ) // John Smith
        So, actually you need to map one array of objects to another. Try using => here. Thereâ€™s a small catch.
