    <h3><b>Anagrams are words that have the same number of same letters, but in different order.</b></h3>
    <pre>
        For instance:
        
        nap - pan
        ear - are - era
        cheaters - hectares - teachers
        Write a function aclean(arr) that returns an array cleaned from anagrams.
        
        For instance:
        
        let arr = ["nap", "teachers", "cheaters", "PAN", "ear", "era", "hectares"];
        
        alert( aclean(arr) ); // "nap,teachers,ear" or "PAN,cheaters,era"
        From every anagram group should remain only one word, no matter which one.
